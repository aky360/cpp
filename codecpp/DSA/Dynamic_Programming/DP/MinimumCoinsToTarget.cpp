/*
Bob went to his favourite bakery to buy some pastries. After picking up his favourite
pastries his total bill was P cents. Bob lives in Berland where all the money is in
the form of coins with denominations {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000}.
Bob is not very good at maths and thinks fewer coins mean less money and he will be
happy if he gives minimum number of coins to the shopkeeper. Help Bob to find the
minimum number of coins that sums to P cents (assume that Bob has an infinite number
of coins of all denominations).
