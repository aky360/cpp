/*
Problem Statement
Given a rod of length ‘N’ units. The rod can be cut into different sizes and each
size has a cost associated with it. Determine the maximum cost obtained by cutting
the rod and selling its pieces.
Note:
1. The sizes will range from 1 to ‘N’ and will be integers.
2. The sum of the pieces cut should be equal to ‘N’.
3. Consider 1-based indexing.
