/*
question:
Mr. X is a skilled burglar who intends to loot houses along a street. Each home has
a specific amount of money tucked away. All of the residences in this area are
grouped in a circle. That is, the first home is next to the final one. Meanwhile,
nearby houses are connected to a security system, which will immediately inform the
police if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.
Given an integer array nums indicating the amount of money in each house. Return the
greatest amount of money Mr. X can rob without notifying the cops.
Example:
Input:
[2, 3, 2]
Output:
3

Ways to write recursive code
1. try to represent the problem in a terms of index
2.Do all possible stuffs on that index and accrodingly to the problem
statement
3. if question asking COUNT ALL WAYS == > Sum of all the stuffs if question
asking MIN OR MAX ==
> Then we will take max or
min from the calculated stuffs

In recusive + memoization
time complexity: O(n)
space complexity: O(n) for array + O(n) because of recursion stack
In dp
