/*
Problem Statement
A thief is robbing a store and can carry a maximal weight of W into his knapsack.
There are N items and the ith item weighs wi and is of value vi. Considering the
constraints of the maximum weight that a knapsack can carry, you have to find and
return the maximum value that a thief can generate by stealing items.
