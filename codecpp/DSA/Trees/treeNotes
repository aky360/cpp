Full Binary Tree:  proper binary tree  
 A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.
 We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children.

Complete Binary Tree:-
A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences:

Every level must be completely filled
All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesnâ€™t have to be a full binary tree.
The following are examples of Complete Binary Trees.

Perfect Binary Tree:-
A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
